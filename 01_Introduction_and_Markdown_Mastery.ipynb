It's super awesome for coding projects, homework, or really any time you need to present code to other people. It's used by people in all stages of coding, from absolute beginners to experts. However, even people who have used Jupyter for years may not know all of its many useful features. \n",

Each notebook will come with explanations of concepts and demonstrations for you to look at and try for yourself. The notebooks are ordered in their titles, but for completion I list them in order here:\n",

    "- **Command** mode allows you to run commands relating to the cells themselves\n",

If you want to enter edit mode and edit a cell, simply double click on the cell you want to edit or press `Enter` if the cell is selected. (A cell is selected if the blue bar on the left side is next to that cell.)\n",

    "Now, once you're in edit mode, things are pretty straightforward--just type what you want in the cell. However, I need to make a few remarks about command mode to show you all the things you can do! Commands are enacted through keyboard shortcuts. There are a lot of them; for a full list, you can go to \"Help\" -> \"Show Keyboard Shortcuts\" from the top bar of your Jupyter menu. However, I'll make a list of the most essential commands below:\n",
    "- `a` (`b`): Creates a new cell above (below) the current cell\n",
    "- `y`/`m`/`r` : Changes a cell's type to code/Markdown/raw text\n",

    "- (`Ctrl`) + `c`/(`Ctrl`) + `v`: Copies/pastes the selected cell(s) (`Ctrl` not needed)\n",
    "- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `up`/`down`: Select cells above/below the current cell\n",
    "- `up`/`down`: Navigate to cells above/below the current cell\n",
    "- `Ctrl` + `Enter`: Run the current cell (without progressing)\n",
    "- `Shift` + `Enter`: Run the current cell and move to the next cell\n",
    "- `Alt` + `Enter`: Run the current cell and insert a new cell below\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more shortcuts with Jupyter, all there to make your life easier. These are perhaps the most important and most common commands you will use, but if you want more, remember again that you can navigate to the keyboard shortcuts list from the Jupyter menu or through `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `H`."
