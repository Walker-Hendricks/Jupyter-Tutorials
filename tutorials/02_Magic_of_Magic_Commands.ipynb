    "In Jupyter, you allow yourself access to a whole host of what are called \"magic commands\". These are commands prefaced by a `%` character, and they operate several features of Jupyter in the backend. These are actually features that even some experienced users of Jupyter are unaware of. They can allow you to fully leverage the power of Jupyter without resorting to other languages or IDEs. They allow you to do a lot, including things like debugging, within the space of the notebook without having the inconvenience of having to leave! So buckle up because things are about to get interesting!"

    "In Jupyter, there are two main types of magic commands: line magics, which operate on a single line, and cell magics, which operate over the whole cell. The main difference is whether you use one `%` character (line) or two (cell). Throughout this section, note that ***you can only use one line magic command per Jupyter cell***. This just comes down to the way Jupyter works. It would be nice to run several, I know, but unfortunately that is not currently possible. With that, let's discuss a few of the important line magics that are most commonly used.\n",

As you have been seeing so far, there are a lot of potential uses of Jupyter magic in your code, but what if the precise magic you want doesn't exist? It's actually a simple enough matter to make your own custom magics. If written within a Jupyter notebook, the commands will only work within the notebook itself after the cell is run.

In case you're unfamiliar, decorators in Python can act like functions that take the actual function you're interested in decorating as an argument. Then they can do some pre- and post-processing on the function. Decorators are typically denoted with the `@` character, followed by the decorator's name. In the `@` framework, the function that gets passed as an argument to the decorator is defined below the decorator itself (though there is a way to do this that involves creating wrapper functions directly, but we don't need to worry about that here). \n",

The Python function will be named whatever string you want to type for the magic command. The function must only take one argument: this will be the text that follows the magic command in the line that its given. As a list summary:\n",
    "- The **decorator** comes first. For line magics, it is always given by `@register_line_magic`\n",
